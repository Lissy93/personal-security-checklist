  intro: >-
    In 2025, over 80% of breaches involve compromised credentials, including AI-generated phishing (per IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report).<grok-card data-id="469933" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Use long, strong, and unique passwords, manage them in a secure password manager, enable
    2-factor authentication, keep on top of breaches, and take care while logging into your accounts.
  checklist:
    - point: Use a Strong Password
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        If your password is too short, or contains dictionary words, places, or names, then it can be easily
        cracked through brute force or guessed by someone. The easiest way to make a strong password is by
        making it long (12+ characters) — consider using a 'passphrase' made up of many words. Alternatively,
        use a password generator to create a long, strong random password. Have a play with
        [Security.org's How Secure Is My Password?](https://security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/), to get an idea of how quickly common
        passwords can be cracked. Read more about creating strong passwords:
        [securityinabox.org](https://securityinabox.org/en/passwords/passwords-and-2fa/).

    - point: Don't Reuse Passwords
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        If someone were to reuse a password and one site they had an account with suffered a leak, then a
        criminal could easily gain unauthorized access to their other accounts. This is usually done through
        large-scale automated login requests, and it is called Credential Stuffing. Unfortunately, this is all
        too common, but it's simple to protect against - use a different password for each of your online accounts.

    - point: Use Passkeys Where Available
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn) are rapidly becoming the default in 2025 for major platforms. They are phishing-resistant and replace passwords with public-key
        cryptography, so there is no shared secret for attackers to steal. Enable passkeys wherever supported and keep at least one hardware security key enrolled
        for your most important accounts as a backup and for services that do not yet support passkeys.<grok-card data-id="a3d65d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

    - point: Use a Secure Password Manager
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        For most people, it is going to be near-impossible to remember hundreds of strong and unique passwords.
        A password manager is an application that generates, stores, and auto-fills your login credentials for you.
        All your passwords will be encrypted against 1 master password (which you must remember, and it should be
        very strong). Most password managers have browser extensions and mobile apps, so whatever device you are on,
        your passwords can be auto-filled. A good all-rounder is
        [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) (open source, independently audited, free tier available) or
        [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass) (integrated with Proton ecosystem, built-in aliases).
        [Recommended Password Managers](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers).

    - point: Avoid Sharing Passwords
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        While there may be times that you need to share access to an account with another person, you should
        generally avoid doing this because it makes it easier for the account to become compromised. If you
        absolutely do need to share a password — for example, when working on a team with a shared account — this
        should be done via features built into a password manager.

    - point: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        2FA is where you must provide both something you know (a password) and something you have (such as a
        code on your phone) to log in. This means that if anyone has your password (e.g., through phishing,
        malware, or a data breach), they will not be able to log into your account. It's easy to get started,
        download [an authenticator app](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#2-factor-authentication)
        onto your phone, and then go to your account security settings and follow the steps to enable 2FA. Next
        time you log in on a new device, you will be prompted for the code that is displayed in the app on your phone
        (it works without internet, and the code usually changes every 30 seconds).

    - point: Keep Backup Codes Safe
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        When you enable multi-factor authentication, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if
        your 2FA method is lost, broken, or unavailable. Keep these codes somewhere safe to prevent loss or
        unauthorized access. You should store these on paper or in a safe place on disk (e.g., in offline storage
        or an encrypted file/drive). Don't store these in your password manager as 2FA sources and passwords
        should be kept separately.

    - point: Sign Up for Breach Alerts
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        After a website suffers a significant data breach, the leaked data often ends up on the internet. Several websites collect
        these leaked records and allow you to search your email address to check if you are in any of their lists.
        [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com), [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com),
        and [DeHashed](https://dehashed.com) allow you to sign up for monitoring, where they will notify you if your
        email address appears in any new data sets. It is useful to know as soon as possible when this happens so
        that you can change your passwords for the affected accounts. [Have i been pwned](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/have-i-been-pwned) also has domain-wide
        notification, where you can receive alerts if any email addresses under your entire domain appear (useful if
        you use aliases for [anonymous forwarding](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#anonymous-mail-forwarding)).
    - point: Beware of AI-Generated Phishing
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        In 2025, AI tools create hyper-personalized phishing emails and deepfake calls. Verify urgent requests via secondary channels (e.g., phone call).
        Use AI-detection browser extensions and enable email filters for anomalies like unusual language or sender mismatches.<grok-card data-id="90dddb" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
    - point: Implement Zero-Trust for Personal Accounts
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Treat every login as untrusted: Use device-bound 2FA, verify app permissions, and audit connected devices quarterly via account settings.
    - point: Prepare for Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Quantum attacks will eventually break today's RSA and ECC. Start inventorying where you rely on long-term confidentiality (backups, email archives,
        password databases) and prefer products that are adding NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber for key establishment and
        Dilithium / FALCON / SPHINCS+ for signatures) over time.<grok-card data-id="1847a1" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

    - point: Shield your Password/PIN
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When typing your password in public places, ensure you are not in direct line of sight of a CCTV camera and
        that no one can see over your shoulder. Cover your password or pin code while you type, and do not
        reveal any plain text passwords on your screen.

    - point: Update Critical Passwords Periodically
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Database leaks and breaches are common, and, likely, several of your passwords are already somewhere
        online. Occasionally updating passwords of security-critical accounts can help mitigate this. But providing
        that all your passwords are long, strong, and unique, there is no need to do this too often — annually should be
        sufficient. Enforcing mandatory password changes within organisations is [no longer recommended](https://duo.com/decipher/microsoft-will-no-longer-recommend-forcing-periodic-password-changes),
        as it encourages colleagues to select weaker passwords.

    - point: Don’t Save your Password in Browsers
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Most modern browsers offer to save your credentials when you log into a site. Don’t allow this, as they are
        not always encrypted and could allow someone to gain access to your accounts. Instead, use a dedicated
        password manager to store (and auto-fill) your passwords.

    - point: Avoid Logging In on Someone Else’s Device
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Avoid logging in on other people's computers since you can't be sure their system is clean. Be especially cautious
        of public machines, as malware and tracking arr more common here. Using someone else's device is especially
        dangerous with critical accounts like online banking. When using someone else's machine, ensure that you're in a
        private/incognito session (Use Ctrl+Shift+N/ Cmd+Shift+N). This will request the browser to not save your credentials,
        cookies, and browsing history.

    - point: Avoid Password Hints
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Some sites allow you to set password hints. Often, it is very easy to guess answers. In cases where password hints
        are mandatory, use random answers and record them in your password manager (`Name of the first school: 6D-02-8B-!a-E8-8F-81`).

    - point: Never Answer Online Security Questions Truthfully
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        If a site asks security questions (such as place of birth, mother's maiden name, or first car, etc.), don't provide
        real answers. It is a trivial task for hackers to find out this information online or through social engineering.
        Instead, create a fictitious answer, and store it inside your password manager. Using real words is better than
        random characters, as [explained here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29244870).

    - point: Don’t Use a 4-digit PIN
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Don’t use a short PIN to access your smartphone or computer. Instead, use a text password or a much longer PIN.
        Numeric passphrases are easy to crack (A 4-digit pin has 10,000 combinations, compared to 7.4 million for a
        4-character alpha-numeric code).

    - point: Avoid Using SMS for 2FA
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When enabling multi-factor authentication, opt for app-based codes or a hardware token if supported. SMS is
        susceptible to several common threats, such as SIM-swapping and SS7 interception. There's also no guarantee of how securely your phone
        number will be stored or what else it will be used for. From a practical point of view, SMS will only work when
        you have a signal and can be slow. If a website or service requires the usage of an SMS number for recovery, consider
        purchasing a second pre-paid phone number only used for account recovery for these instances.

    - point: Avoid Using your PM to Generate OTPs
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Many password managers are also able to generate 2FA codes. It is best not to use your primary password manager
        as your 2FA authenticator as well, since it would become a single point of failure if compromised. Instead, use a
        dedicated [authenticator app](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#2-factor-authentication) on your phone or laptop.

    - point: Avoid Face Unlock
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Most phones and laptops offer a facial recognition authentication feature, using the camera to compare a snapshot
        of your face with a stored hash. It may be very convenient, but there are numerous ways to [fool it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2017/09/18/security-apple-face-id-iphone-x/)
        and gain access to the device through digital photos and reconstructions from CCTV footage. Unlike your password,
        there are likely photos of your face on the internet and videos recorded by surveillance cameras.

    - point: Watch Out for Keyloggers
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        A hardware [keylogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_keylogger) is a physical device planted between
        your keyboard and the USB port, which intercepts all keystrokes and sometimes relays data to a remote server.
        It gives a hacker access to everything typed, including passwords. The best way to stay protected is just by
        checking your USB connection after your PC has been unattended. It is also possible for keyloggers to be planted
        inside the keyboard housing, so look for any signs that the case has been tampered with, and consider bringing your
        own keyboard to work. Data typed on a virtual keyboard, pasted from the clipboard, or auto-filled by a password
        manager can not be intercepted by a hardware keylogger.

    - point: Consider a Hardware Token
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        A FIDO2 security key (YubiKey, Nitrokey, SoloKey, Google Titan, etc.) is currently the most secure 2FA method.
        It provides strong phishing resistance because the authenticator cryptographically proves the origin. Use it for
        high-value accounts (email, banking, crypto). Many services now support multiple keys – register at least two
        so you are not locked out if one is lost.

    - point: Consider Offline Password Manager
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        For increased security, an encrypted offline password manager will give you full control over your data.
        [KeePass](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/password-managers/keepass) is a popular choice, with lots of [plugins](https://keepass.info/plugins.html) and
        community forks with additional compatibility and functionality. Popular clients include: [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org)
        (desktop), [KeePassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com) (Android) and [StrongBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strongbox-password-safe/id897283731)
        (iOS). The drawback being that it may be slightly less convenient for some, and it will be up to you to back it up
        and store it securely.

    - point: Consider Unique Usernames
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Having different passwords for each account is a good first step, but if you also use a unique username, email, or
        phone number to log in, then it will be significantly harder for anyone trying to gain unauthorised access. The easiest
        method for multiple emails is using auto-generated aliases for anonymous mail forwarding. This is where
        [anything]@yourdomain.com will arrive in your inbox, allowing you to use a different email for each account (see
        [Mail Alias Providers](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#mail-forwarding)). Usernames are easier
        since you can use your password manager to generate, store, and auto-fill these. Virtual phone numbers can be generated
        through your VOIP provider.

    - point: Audit Single Sign-On and Connected Apps
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        “Sign in with Google / Apple / Microsoft” is convenient but it also links many apps and services to the same identity. Periodically review which
        mobile apps and websites are connected to your main identity provider accounts and revoke access for those you no longer use. Where possible, use
        aliases or separate identities for high-risk or experimental apps so compromise or data sharing in one place does not expose your entire digital footprint.

  description: Avoiding tracking, censorship, and data collection online
  icon: browser
  intro: >-
    In 2025, GenAI amplifies tracking via predictive profiling; most sites deploy advanced behavioral analytics.<grok-card data-id="fabbc8" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> This data can provide
    deep insight into their users behaviour and preferences. This data can be incredibly
    detailed, and so is extremely valuable to corporations, governments and intellectual
    property thieves. Data breaches and leaks are common, and deanonymizing users web
    activity is often a trivial task.


    There are two primary methods of tracking; stateful (cookie-based), and stateless
    (fingerprint-based). Cookies are small pieces of information, stored in your browser
    with a unique ID that is used to identify you. Browser fingerprinting is a highly
    accurate way to identify and track users wherever they go online. The information
    collected is quite comprehensive, and often includes browser details, OS, screen
    resolution, supported fonts, plugins, time zone, language and font preferences,
    and even hardware configurations.


    This section outlines the steps you can take, to be better protected from threats,
    minimise online tracking and improve privacy.
  checklist:
    - point: Block Ads
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Using an ad-blocker can help improve your privacy, by blocking the trackers that ads implement.
        [uBlock Origin](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/ad-blockers/ublock-origin) is a very
        efficient and open source browser addon,
        developed by Raymond Hill. When 3rd-party ads are displayed on a webpage, they have the ability to
        track you, gathering personal information about you and your habits, which can then be sold, or used
        to show you more targeted ads, and some ads are plain malicious or fake. Blocking ads also makes pages
        load faster, uses less data and provides a less cluttered experience.

    - point: Ensure Website is Legitimate
      priority: Basic
      details: >-
        It may sound obvious, but when you logging into any online accounts, double check the URL is correct.
        Storing commonly visited sites in your bookmarks is a good way to ensure the URL is easy to find. When
        visiting new websites, look for common signs that it could be unsafe: Browser warnings, redirects,
        on-site spam and pop-ups. You can also check a website using a tool, such as:
        [Virus Total](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/virus-total),
        [IsLegitSite](https://www.islegitsite.com), [Google Safe Browsing Status](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search)
        if you are unsure.

    - point: Watch out for Browser Malware
      priority: Basic
      details: >-
        Your system or browser can be compromised by spyware, miners, browser hijackers, malicious redirects,
        adware etc. You can usually stay protected, just by: ignoring pop-ups, be wary of what your clicking,
        don't proceed to a website if your browser warns you it may be malicious. Common signs of browser malware
        include: default search engine or homepage has been modified, toolbars, unfamiliar extensions or icons,
        significantly more ads, errors and pages loading much slower than usual. These articles from Heimdal
        explain [signs of browser malware](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/warning-signs-operating-system-infected-malware),
        [how browsers get infected](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/practical-online-protection-where-malware-hides)
        and [how to remove browser malware](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/malware-removal).

    - point: Use a Privacy-Respecting Browser
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        LibreWolf, Mullvad Browser, or hardened Firefox are currently the strongest choices for desktop.
        Brave remains a solid option with strong built-in blocking. Avoid unhardened Chrome, Edge, and Safari.
        Recommended configurations: LibreWolf (out-of-the-box), arkenfox user.js for Firefox, or Mullvad Browser.
        See: [Privacy Browsers](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy#browsers).

    - point: Beware “Open in App” Prompts
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Many sites try to push you into their native mobile or desktop apps with full-screen banners and “Continue in app” buttons. Native apps typically have
        broader access to device identifiers, sensors and background activity than a hardened browser tab. When privacy matters, prefer staying in the browser
        instead of installing yet another app.

    - point: Use a Private Search Engine
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Using a privacy-preserving, non-tracking search engine will reduce the risk that your search terms are logged and profiled. Consider
        [DuckDuckGo](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/search-engines/duckduckgo), [Qwant](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/search-engines/qwant),
        [Brave Search](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/search-engines/brave-search) or a self-hosted metasearch like SearxNG.
        Google implements some [incredibly invasive](https://hackernoon.com/data-privacy-concerns-with-google-b946f2b7afea)
        tracking policies, and have a history of displaying [biased search results](https://www.businessinsider.com/evidence-that-google-search-results-are-biased-2014-10).
        Therefore Google, along with Bing, Baidu, Yahoo and Yandex are incompatible with anyone looking to protect
        their privacy. It is recommended to update your [browsers default search](https://duckduckgo.com/install)
        to a privacy-respecting search engine.

    - point: Remove Unnecessary Browser Addons
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Extensions are able to see, log or modify anything you do in the browser, and some innocent looking
        browser apps, have malicious intentions. Websites can see which extensions you have installed, and may
        use this to enhance your fingerprint, to more accurately identify/ track you. Both [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox) and Chrome
        web stores allow you to check what permissions/access rights an extension requires before you install it.
        Check the reviews. Only install extensions you really need, and removed those which you haven't used in a while.

    - point: Keep Browser Up-to-date
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Browser vulnerabilities are constantly being [discovered](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=browser)
        and patched, so it’s important to keep it up to date, to avoid a zero-day exploit. You can [see which browser
        version you're using here](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/), or follow [this guide](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-update-your-browser/)
        for instructions on how to update. Some browsers will auto-update to the latest stable version.

    - point: Check for HTTPS
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Do not enter any data on a non-HTTPS website. Data transported over plain HTTP is unencrypted and can be read by anyone who intercepts it.
        Most modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari) now have a built-in "HTTPS-Only Mode" that automatically forces secure connections.
        You should enable this in your browser settings. The previously popular HTTPS-Everywhere extension has been discontinued and is no longer needed.

    - point: Use DNS-over-HTTPS
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Traditional DNS makes requests in plain text for everyone to see. It allows for eavesdropping and
        manipulation of DNS data through man-in-the-middle attacks. Whereas DNS-over-HTTPS performs DNS
        resolution via the HTTPS protocol, meaning data between you and your DNS resolver is encrypted.
        A popular option is [CloudFlare](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/dns-providers/cloudflare)'s [1.1.1.1](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/mobile-apps/1.1.1.1), or compare providers- it is simple to enable in-browser.
        Note that DoH comes with its own issues, mostly preventing web filtering. For enhanced privacy, consider DNS-over-TLS (DoT).
    - point: Block AI-Driven Trackers
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Emerging GenAI trackers predict user intent from partial data. Use extensions like uBlock Origin with custom filters for AI endpoints (e.g., OpenAI APIs).
        Regularly review and revoke third-party data shares in browser settings.<grok-card data-id="ee945d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
    - point: Secure AI Browser Agents
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        AI agents (e.g., ChatGPT Atlas) risk prompt injection; limit permissions, use sandboxed sessions, and verify outputs for sensitive tasks.<grok-card data-id="83b1c4" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

    - point: Multi-[Session](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/encrypted-messaging/session) Containers
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Compartmentalisation is really important to keep different aspects of your browsing separate. For
        example, using different profiles for work, general browsing, social media, online shopping etc
        will reduce the number associations that data brokers can link back to you. One option is to make
        use of [Firefox Containers](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/firefox-multi-account-containers)
        which is designed exactly for this purpose.
        Alternatively, you could
        use different browsers for different tasks
        ([Brave](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/brave-browser),
        [Firefox](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/essentials/browsers/firefox),
        [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor) etc).

    - point: Use Incognito
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        When using someone else's machine, ensure that you're in a private/ incognito session. This will
        prevent browser history, cookies and some data being saved, but is not fool-proof- you can still
        be tracked.

    - point: Understand Your Browser Fingerprint

    - point: Beware of Redirects
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        While some redirects are harmless, others, such as Unvalidated redirects are used in phishing attacks,
        it can make a malicious link seem legitimate. If you are unsure about a redirect URL, you can check
        where it forwards to with a tool like RedirectDetective.

    - point: Do Not Sign Into Your Browser
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Many browsers allow you to sign in, in order to sync history, bookmarks and other browsing data across
        devices. However this not only allows for further data collection, but also increases attack surface
        through providing another avenue for a malicious actor to get hold of personal information.

    - point: Disallow Prediction Services
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Some browsers allow for prediction services, where you receive real-time search results or URL auto-fill.
        If this is enabled then data is sent to Google (or your default search engine) with every keypress,
        rather than when you hit enter.

    - point: Avoid G Translate for Webpages
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When you visit a web page written in a foreign language, you may be prompted to install the Google Translate
        extension. Be aware that Google collects all data (including input fields), along with details of the current
        user. Instead use a translation service that is not linked to your browser.

    - point: Disable Web Notifications
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Browser push notifications are a common method for criminals to encourage you to click their link, since

    - point: Deactivate ActiveX
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        ActiveX is a browser extension API that built into Microsoft IE, and enabled by default. It's not commonly
        used anymore, but since it gives plugins intimate access rights, and can be dangerous, therefore you should
        disable it.

    - point: Disable WebRTC
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        WebRTC allows high-quality audio/video communication and peer-to-peer file-sharing straight from the
        browser. However it can pose as a privacy leak. To learn more, check out this guide.

    - point: Spoof HTML5 Canvas Sig
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Canvas Fingerprinting allows websites to identify and track users very accurately. You can use the
        Canvas-Fingerprint-Blocker extension to spoof your fingerprint or
        use [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor).

    - point: Spoof User Agent
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        The user agent tells the website what device, browser and version you are using. Switching user agent
        periodically is one small step you can take to become less unique.

    - point: Enable Global Privacy Control (GPC)
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        The old "Do Not Track" (DNT) standard is dead. Replace it with [Global Privacy Control (GPC)](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/),
        which is a legally binding signal under laws like the CCPA/CPRA (California) and GDPR. Browsers like Firefox and Brave support
        this natively. It signals to websites that you do not want your data sold or shared.

    - point: Prevent HSTS Tracking
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        HSTS was designed to help secure websites, but privacy concerns have been raised as it allowed site

        Chromium-based browsers.

    - point: Prevent Automatic Browser Connections
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Even when you are not using your browser, it may call home to report on usage activity, analytics and
        diagnostics. You may wish to disable some of this, which can be done through the settings.

    - point: Enable 1st-Party Isolation
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        [First Party Isolation](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/first-party-isolation) means
        that all identifier sources and browser state are scoped using the URL bar
        domain, this can greatly reduce tracking.

    - point: Strip Tracking Params from URLs
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Websites often append additional GET parameters to URLs that you click, to identify information like
        source/referrer. You can sanitize manually,
        or use an extension like [ClearURLs](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/browser-extensions/clearurls) to strip tracking data
        from URLs automatically.

    - point: First Launch Security
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        After installing a web browser, the first time you launch it (prior to configuring its privacy settings),
        most browsers will call home. Therefore, after installing a browser, you should first disable your internet
        connection, then configure privacy options before reenabling your internet connectivity.

    - point: Use The Tor Browser
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        The [Tor](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/networking/mix-networks/tor) Project provides a browser that encrypts and routes your traffic through multiple nodes, keeping
        users safe from interception and tracking. The main drawbacks are speed and user experience.

    - point: Disable JavaScript
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Many modern web apps are JavaScript-based, so disabling it will greatly decrease your browsing experience.
        But if you really want to go all out, then it will really reduce your attack surface.

  description: Protecting the gateway to your online accounts
  icon: email
  intro: >-
    With 2025's expansion of U.S. state privacy laws (e.g., Delaware, Nebraska effective Jan 1), email remains a high-risk vector for data sales and profiling.<grok-card data-id="25a4cf" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card> Nearly 50 years since the first email was sent, it's still very much a big part
    of our day-to-day life, and will continue to be for the near future. So considering
    how much trust we put in them, it's surprising how fundamentally insecure this
    infrastructure is. Email-related fraud
    [is on the up](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247670/email/email-security-in-2018.html),
    and without taking basic measures you could be at risk.


    If a hacker gets access to your emails, it provides a gateway for your other
    accounts to be compromised (through password resets), therefore email security
    is paramount for your digital safety.


    The big companies providing "free" email service, don't have a good reputation
    for respecting users privacy: Gmail was caught giving
    [third parties full access](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-dirty-secret-the-app-developers-sifting-through-your-gmail-1530544442)
    to user emails and also [tracking all of your purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/google-gmail-tracks-purchase-history-how-to-delete-it.html).
    Yahoo was also caught scanning emails in real-time [for US surveillance agencies](http://news.trust.org/item/20161004170601-99f8c)
    Advertisers [were granted access](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2018/08/29/both-yahoo-and-aol-are-scanning-customer-emails-to-attract-advertisers)
    to Yahoo and AOL users messages to “identify and segment potential customers by picking up on contextual buying signals, and past purchases.”

  checklist:
    - point: Have more than one email address
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Consider using a different email address for security-critical communications from trivial mail such
        as newsletters. This compartmentalization could reduce the amount of damage caused by a data breach,
        and also make it easier to recover a compromised account.

    - point: Keep Email Address Private
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Do not share your primary email publicly, as mail addresses are often the starting point for most
        phishing attacks.

    - point: Keep your Account Secure
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Use a long and unique password, enable 2FA and be careful while logging in. Your email account
        provides an easy entry point to all your other online accounts for an attacker.

    - point: Disable Automatic Loading of Remote Content
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Email messages can contain remote content such as images or stylesheets, often automatically loaded
        from the server. You should disable this, as it exposes your IP address and device information, and
        is often used for tracking. For more info, see [this article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20680903/email-pixel-trackers-how-to-stop-images-automatic-download).

    - point: Use Plaintext
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        There are two main types of emails on the internet: plaintext and HTML. The former is strongly preferred
        for privacy & security as HTML messages often include identifiers in links and inline images, which can
        collect usage and personal data. There's also numerous risks of remote code execution targeting the HTML
        parser of your mail client, which cannot be exploited if you are using plaintext. For more info, as well
        as setup instructions for your mail provider, see [UsePlaintext.email](https://useplaintext.email/).

    - point: Don't connect third-party apps to your email account
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        If you give a third-party app or plug-in full access to your inbox, they effectively have full unhindered
        access to all your emails and their contents, which poses significant security and privacy risks. This includes "smart inbox" and
        marketing-automation apps on mobile that connect via IMAP or OAuth; assume they can read, copy, and profile everything you receive and send.

    - point: Don't Share Sensitive Data via Email
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Emails are very easily intercepted. Furthermore, you can’t be sure of how secure your recipient's
        environment is. Therefore, emails cannot be considered safe for exchanging confidential information,
        unless it is encrypted.

    - point: Consider Switching to a Secure Mail Provider
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Secure and reputable email providers such as [Forward Email](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/encrypted-email/forward-email),
        [ProtonMail](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/mail-forwarding/protonmail),
        and [Tuta](https://tuta.com) (formerly Tutanota) allow for end-to-end
        encryption, full privacy as well as more security-focused features. Unlike typical email providers, your
        mailbox cannot be read by anyone but you, since all messages are encrypted.

    - point: Use Smart Key
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        OpenPGP does not support Forward secrecy, which means if either your or the recipient's private key is
        ever stolen, all previous messages encrypted with it will be exposed. Therefore, you should take great
        care to keep your private keys safe. One method of doing so, is to use a USB Smart Key to sign or decrypt
        messages, allowing you to do so without your private key leaving the USB device.

    - point: Use Aliasing / Anonymous Forwarding
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Email aliasing allows messages to be sent to [anything]@my-domain.com and still land in your primary inbox.
        Services like [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io), [Addy.io](https://addy.io), or Apple's "Hide My Email" allow you to use a
        different, unique email address for each service you sign up for. This means if you start receiving spam, you can block that
        specific alias and determine exactly which company leaked your email address.

    - point: Subaddressing
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        An alternative to aliasing is subaddressing, where anything after the `+` symbol is omitted during mail delivery.
        This enables you to keep track of who shared/ leaked your email address, but unlike aliasing, it will not protect
        against your real address being revealed.

    - point: Use a Custom Domain
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Using a custom domain means that you are not dependent on the address assigned by your mail provider. So you can
        easily switch providers in the future and do not need to worry about a service being discontinued.

    - point: Sync with a client for backup
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        To avoid losing temporary or permanent access to your emails during an unplanned event (such as an outage or
        account lock), Thunderbird can sync/ backup messages from multiple accounts via IMAP and store locally on your
        primary device.

    - point: Be Careful with Mail Signatures
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        You do not know how secure of an email environment the recipient of your message may have. There are several
        extensions that automatically crawl messages, and create a detailed database of contact information based upon
        email signatures.

    - point: Be Careful with Auto-Replies
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Out-of-office automatic replies are very useful for informing people there will be a delay in replying, but all
        too often people reveal too much information- which can be used in social engineering and targeted attacks.

    - point: Choose the Right Mail Protocol
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Do not use outdated protocols (below IMAPv4 or POPv3), both have known vulnerabilities and out-dated security.

    - point: Self-Hosting
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Self-hosting your own mail server is not recommended for non-advanced users, since correctly securing it is
        critical yet requires strong networking knowledge.

    - point: Always use TLS Ports
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        There are SSL options for POP3, IMAP, and SMTP as standard TCP/IP ports. They are easy to use, and widely
        supported so should always be used instead of plaintext email ports.

    - point: DNS Availability
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        For self-hosted mail servers, to prevent DNS problems impacting availability- use at least 2 MX records, with
        secondary and tertiary MX records for redundancy when the primary MX record fails.

    - point: Prevent DDoS and Brute Force Attacks
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        For self-hosted mail servers (specifically SMTP), limit your total number of simultaneous connections, and maximum
        connection rate to reduce the impact of attempted bot attacks.

    - point: Maintain IP Blacklist
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        For self-hosted mail servers, you can improve spam filters and harden security, through maintaining an up-to-date
        local IP blacklist and a spam URI realtime block lists to filter out malicious hyperlinks.

    - point: Control AI and Auto-Summarization Features
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        New email clients and add-ins offer AI-based summarization, drafting, and “smart reply” features. Before enabling them, check where your
        message content is processed and stored. Prefer on-device or self-hosted models for sensitive mail and disable AI features that require sending
        full message bodies to third-party clouds.

  intro: ""
  checklist:
    - point: Only Use Fully End-to-End Encrypted Messengers
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        End-to-end encryption is a system of communication where messages are encrypted on your device and
        not decrypted until they reach the intended recipient. This ensures that any actor who intercepts
        traffic cannot read the message contents, nor can anybody with access to the central servers where
        data is stored.

    - point: Use only Open Source Messaging Platforms
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        If code is open source then it can be independently examined and audited by anyone qualified to do
        so, to ensure that there are no backdoors, vulnerabilities, or other security issues.

    - point: Use a "Trustworthy" Messaging Platform
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        When selecting an encrypted messaging app, ensure it's fully open source, stable, actively maintained,
        and ideally backed by reputable developers.

    - point: Check Security Settings
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Enable security settings, including contact verification, security notifications, and encryption.
        Disable optional non-security features such as read receipt, last online, and typing notification.

    - point: Ensure your Recipients Environment is Secure
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Your conversation can only be as secure as the weakest link. Often the easiest way to infiltrate a
        communications channel is to target the individual or node with the least protection.

    - point: Disable Cloud Services
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Some mobile messaging apps offer a web or desktop companion and cloud backup. These increase attack surface and often store messages or metadata
        in a way that is no longer end-to-end encrypted. Where possible, disable chat backups to generic cloud storage, and treat web/desktop bridges as
        temporary sessions you sign out of when done.

    - point: Secure Group Chats
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        The risk of compromise rises exponentially, the more participants are in a group, as the attack surface
        increases. Periodically check that all participants are legitimate.

    - point: Create a Safe Environment for Communication
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        There are several stages where your digital communications could be monitored or intercepted. This includes:
        your or your participants' device, your ISP, national gateway or government logging, the messaging provider,
        the servers.

    - point: Agree on a Communication Plan
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        In certain situations, it may be worth making a communication plan. This should include primary and backup
        methods of securely getting in hold with each other.

    - point: Strip Meta-Data from Media
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Metadata is "Data about Data" or additional information attached to a file or transaction. When you send a
        photo, audio recording, video, or document you may be revealing more than you intended to.

    - point: Defang URLs
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Sending links via various services can unintentionally expose your personal information. This is because,
        when a thumbnail or preview is generated- it happens on the client-side.

    - point: Control Link Previews and AI Features
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Many messengers fetch link previews or run AI features on their own servers, which can expose the URLs you share and sometimes the content
        of linked pages or messages. Disable link previews in sensitive chats and turn off cloud-based AI summarization or translation for conversations
        that contain confidential information.

    - point: Verify your Recipient
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Always ensure you are talking to the intended recipient, and that they have not been compromised. One method
        for doing so is to use an app which supports contact verification.

    - point: Enable Ephemeral Messages
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Self-destructing messages is a feature that causes your messages to automatically delete after a set amount
        of time. This means that if your device is lost, stolen, or seized, an adversary will only have access to the
        most recent communications.

    - point: Avoid SMS
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        SMS may be convenient, but it's not secure. It is susceptible to threats such as interception, sim swapping,
        manipulation, and malware.

    - point: Watch out for Trackers
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Be wary of messaging applications with trackers, as the detailed usage statistics they collect are often very
        invasive, and can sometimes reveal your identity as well as personal information that you would otherwise not
        intend to share.

    - point: Consider Jurisdiction
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        The jurisdictions where the organisation is based, and data is hosted should also be taken into account.

    - point: Use an Anonymous Platform
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        If you believe you may be targeted, you should opt for an anonymous messaging platform that does not require
        a phone number, or any other personally identifiable information to sign up or use.

    - point: Ensure Forward Secrecy is Supported

  description: Minimizing the risks associated with using online communities
  icon: social
  intro: >
    Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet, and give
    people around the world the opportunity to connect, communicate and share.
    Although these networks are a great way to promote social interaction and
    bring people together, that have a dark side - there are some serious
    [Privacy Concerns with Social Networking Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_with_social_networking_services),
    and these social networking sites are owned by private corporations,
    and that they make their money by collecting data about individuals and
    selling that data on, often to third party advertisers.

    Secure your account, lock down your privacy settings, but know that even
    after doing so, all data intentionally and non-intentionally uploaded is
    effectively public. If possible, avoid using conventional social media networks.
  checklist:
    - point: Secure your Account
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Social media profiles get stolen or taken over all too often. To protect your account: use a unique
        and strong password, and enable 2-factor authentication.

    - point: Check Privacy Settings
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Most social networks allow you to control your privacy settings. Ensure that you are comfortable with
        what data you are currently exposing and to whom.

    - point: Think of All Interactions as Public
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        There are still numerous methods of viewing a users 'private' content across many social networks.
        Therefore, before uploading, posting or commenting on anything, think "Would I mind if this was totally public?"

    - point: Think of All Interactions as Permanent
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Pretty much every post, comment, photo etc is being continuously backed up by a myriad of third-party
        services, who archive this data and make it indexable and publicly available almost forever.

    - point: Don't Reveal too Much
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Profile information creates a goldmine of info for hackers, the kind of data that helps them personalize
        phishing scams. Avoid sharing too much detail (DoB, Hometown, School etc).

    - point: Be Careful what you Upload
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Status updates, comments, check-ins and media can unintentionally reveal a lot more than you intended
        them to. This is especially relevant to photos and videos, which may show things in the background.

    - point: Don't Share Email or Phone Number
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Posting your real email address or mobile number, gives hackers, trolls and spammers more munition to
        use against you, and can also allow separate aliases, profiles or data points to be connected.

    - point: Don't Grant Unnecessary Permissions
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        By default many of the popular social networking apps will ask for permission to access your contacts,
        call log, location, messaging history etc. If they don't need this access, don't grant it. Use your phone's permission manager to periodically
        review which social apps can see your address book, photos and location and revoke anything non-essential.

    - point: Be Careful of 3rd-Party Integrations
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Avoid signing up for accounts using a Social Network login, revoke access to social apps you no longer
        use.

    - point: Prefer the Browser to Social Apps
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When possible, access social networks via a hardened browser instead of their native apps. Browser tabs are easier to containerize and block with
        extensions, while social apps often run persistently, collect more telemetry, and may sync contacts or activity in the background.

    - point: Avoid Publishing Geo Data while still Onsite
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        If you plan to share any content that reveals a location, then wait until you have left that place.
        This is particularly important when you are taking a trip, at a restaurant, campus, hotel/resort, public
        building or airport.

    - point: Remove metadata before uploading media
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Most smartphones and some cameras automatically attach a comprehensive set of additional data (called
        EXIF data) to each photograph. Remove this data before uploading.

    - point: Implement Image Cloaking
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Tools like Fawkes can be used to very subtly, slightly change the structure of faces within photos in a
        way that is imperceptible by humans, but will prevent facial recognition systems from being able to recognize
        a given face.

    - point: Consider Spoofing GPS in home vicinity
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Even if you yourself never use social media, there is always going to be others who are not as careful,
        and could reveal your location.

    - point: Consider False Information
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        If you just want to read, and do not intend on posting too much- consider using an alias name, and false
        contact details.

    - point: Don’t have any social media accounts
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Social media is fundamentally un-private, so for maximum online security and privacy, avoid using any
        mainstream social networks.

        Manufacturers release firmware updates that fix security vulnerabilities, implement new standards, and
        sometimes add features or improve the performance of your router.

    - point: Implement a Network-Wide VPN
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        If you configure your VPN on your router, firewall, or home server, then traffic from all devices will
        be encrypted and routed through it, without needing individual VPN apps.

    - point: Protect against DNS leaks
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        When using a VPN, it is extremely important to exclusively use the DNS server of your VPN provider or
        secure service.

    - point: Use a secure VPN Protocol
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        OpenVPN and WireGuard are open source, lightweight, and secure tunneling protocols. Avoid using PPTP
        or SSTP.

    - point: Secure DNS
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Use DNS-over-HTTPS which performs DNS resolution via the HTTPS protocol, encrypting data between you
        and your DNS resolver. For quantum resistance, evaluate post-quantum DNS options emerging in 2025.
    - point: Prepare for Quantum Threats
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        Quantum computing risks breaking current encryption; migrate to quantum-resistant VPN protocols (e.g., Kyber-based) where available.

    - point: Avoid the free router from your ISP
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Typically they’re manufactured cheaply in bulk in China, with insecure propriety firmware that doesn't
        receive regular security updates.

    - point: Whitelist MAC Addresses
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        You can whitelist MAC addresses in your router settings, disallowing any unknown devices to immediately
        connect to your network, even if they know your credentials.

    - point: Change the Router’s Local IP Address
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        It is possible for a malicious script in your web browser to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability,
        accessing known-vulnerable routers at their local IP address and tampering with them.

    - point: Don't Reveal Personal Info in SSID
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        You should update your network name, choosing an SSID that does not identify you, include your flat
        number/address, and does not specify the device brand/model.

    - point: Opt-Out Router Listings
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        WiFi SSIDs are scanned, logged, and then published on various websites, which is a serious privacy
        concern for some.

    - point: Hide your SSID
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Your router's Service Set Identifier is simply the network name. If it is not visible, it may receive
        less abuse.

    - point: Disable WPS
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Wi-Fi Protected Setup provides an easier method to connect, without entering a long WiFi password, but
        WPS introduces a series of major security issues.

    - point: Disable UPnP
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Universal Plug and Play allows applications to automatically forward a port on your router, but it has
        a long history of serious security issues.

    - point: Use a Guest Network for Guests
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Do not grant access to your primary WiFi network to visitors, as it enables them to interact with other
        devices on the network.

    - point: Change your Router's Default IP
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Modifying your router admin panel's default IP address will make it more difficult for malicious scripts
        targeting local IP addresses.


    - point: Secure 5G Connections

  description: Reduce invasive tracking for cells, smartphones and tablets
  icon: mobile
  intro: >
    Smart phones have revolutionized so many aspects of life and brought the world
    to our fingertips. For many of us, smart phones are our primary means of communication,
    entertainment and access to knowledge. But while they've brought convenience
    to whole new level, there's some ugly things going on behind the screen.

    Geo-tracking is used to trace our every move, and we have little control over
    who has this data- your phone is even able to
    [track your location without GPS](https://gizmodo.com/how-to-track-a-cellphone-without-gps-or-consent-1821125371).
    Over the years numerous reports that surfaced, outlining ways in which your
    phone's [mic can eavesdrop](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/smartphone-apps-listening-privacy-alphonso-shazam-advertising-pool-3d-honey-quest-a8139451.html),
    and the [camera can watch you](https://www.businessinsider.com/hackers-governments-smartphone-iphone-camera-wikileaks-cybersecurity-hack-privacy-webcam-2017-6)- all without your knowledge or consent.
    And then there's the malicious apps, lack of security patches and potential/ likely backdoors.

    Using a smart phone generates a lot of data about you- from information you
    intentionally share, to data silently generated from your actions.
    It can be scary to see what Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook know about
    us- sometimes they know more than our closest family. It's hard to comprehend
    what your data will reveal, especially in conjunction with other data.

    This data is used for
    [far more than just advertising](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-sides-of-data-tracking/) -
    more often it's used to rate people for finance, insurance and employment.
    Targeted ads can even be used for fine-grained surveillance (see [ADINT](https://adint.cs.washington.edu))

    More of us are concerned about how
    [governments use collect and use our smart phone data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/373916/global-opinion-online-monitoring-government/),
    and rightly so, federal agencies often
    [request our data from Google](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273501/global-data-requests-from-google-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
    [Facebook](https://www.statista.com/statistics/287845/global-data-requests-from-facebook-by-federal-agencies-and-governments/),
    Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies. Sometimes requests are
    made in bulk, returning detailed information on everybody within a certain geo-fence,
    [often for innocent people](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html).
    And this doesn't include all of the internet traffic that intelligence agencies around the world have unhindered access to.

    Separate from the network and location layer, one of the biggest ongoing privacy risks now comes from the apps you install. Large-scale studies of Android and iOS apps show that most include third-party tracking components, and that categories like shopping and food-delivery collect particularly broad sets of data (device identifiers, usage patterns, location, purchase history) that are shared with multiple companies. Browsers give you more control over this data flow; native apps typically do not.
  checklist:
    - point: Encrypt your Device
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        In order to keep your data safe from physical access, use file encryption. This will mean if your
        device is lost or stolen, no one will have access to your data.

    - point: Turn off connectivity features that aren’t being used
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        When you're not using WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC etc, turn those features off. There are several common threats
        that utilise these features.

    - point: Keep app count to a minimum
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Uninstall apps that you don’t need or use regularly. Each extra app increases your attack surface and the amount of background data collection taking place on your device.

    - point: Understand Smartphone App Data Collection
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Popular apps typically embed multiple third-party trackers and analytics SDKs. These can collect information about your device, location, identifiers and in-app behavior and send it to external companies, often in the background. Shopping, food-delivery and social media apps are consistently among the most data-hungry, so install as few of them as possible and remove ones you no longer truly need.

    - point: App Permissions
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Don’t grant apps permissions that they don’t need. Use your OS privacy features (e.g., granular permission prompts, App Tracking Transparency and App Privacy Report on iOS, Privacy Dashboard on Android) to give apps the minimum access necessary, ideally “only while using the app”. For Android, [Bouncer](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/mobile-apps/bouncer) is an app that allows you to grant temporary / one-off permissions.

    - point: Only install Apps from official source
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Applications on Apple App Store and Google Play Store are scanned and cryptographically signed, making them
        less likely to contain outright malware. But this review does not prevent apps from embedding extensive tracking and data collection. Treat “official” apps as potentially invasive and still evaluate their permissions and trackers before installing.

    - point: Be Careful of Phone Charging Threats
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Juice Jacking is when hackers use public charging stations to install malware on your smartphone or tablet
        through a compromised USB port.

    - point: Set up a mobile carrier PIN
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        SIM hijacking is when a hacker is able to get your mobile number transferred to their sim. The easiest way
        to protect against this is to set up a PIN through your mobile provider.

    - point: Opt-out of Caller ID Listings
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        To keep your details private, you can unlist your number from caller ID apps like TrueCaller, CallApp, SyncMe,
        and Hiya.

    - point: Use Offline Maps
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Consider using an offline maps app, such as OsmAnd or Organic Maps, to reduce data leaks from map apps.

    - point: Opt-out of personalized ads
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        You can slightly reduce the amount of data collected by opting-out of seeing personalized ads in your device’s privacy / ads settings, both for the OS vendor and for individual apps where available.

    - point: Reset and Limit Ad Identifiers
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Both Android and iOS assign your device an advertising identifier that apps can use to link your activity across apps and services. Regularly reset this ID in system settings and disable personalized ads where possible to make long-term profiling more difficult.

    - point: Erase after too many login attempts
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        To protect against an attacker brute forcing your pin, set your device to erase after too many failed
        login attempts.

    - point: Monitor Trackers in Your Apps
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Use tools like [εxodus](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/online-tools/εxodus) to see which trackers and permissions are embedded in Android apps, and your OS privacy dashboard to review which apps access sensitive data. If an app includes many trackers or requests sensitive access it does not need, uninstall it or block its network access.

    - point: Use a Mobile Firewall or DNS Filter
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        To prevent applications from leaking privacy-sensitive data, use a firewall or DNS-filtering app to control which domains each app can reach. This can reveal constant background connections to analytics and advertising endpoints and lets you block them while keeping core functionality.

    - point: Reduce Background Activity
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Restrict background data and activity for apps that do not truly need it. On Android, tools like SuperFreeze can entirely freeze background activities on a per-app basis; on iOS, disable “Background App Refresh” for non-essential apps. This reduces silent tracking, battery drain, and accidental data leaks.

    - point: Sandbox Mobile Apps
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Prevent permission-hungry apps from accessing your private data with [Island](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/mobile-apps/island), a sandbox environment.

    - point: Tor Traffic
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        [Orbot](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/security-tools/mobile-apps/orbot) provides
        a system-wide Tor connection, which will help protect you from surveillance and public WiFi threats.

    - point: Avoid Custom Virtual Keyboards
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        It is recommended to stick with your device's stock keyboard. If you choose to use a third-party keyboard app,
        ensure it is reputable.

    - point: Restart Device Regularly
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Restarting your phone at least once a week will clear the app state cached in memory and may run more smoothly
        after a restart.

    - point: Avoid SMS
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        SMS should not be used to receive 2FA codes or for communication, instead use an encrypted messaging app,
        such as [Signal](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/communication/encrypted-messaging/signal).

    - point: Keep your Number Private
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        [MySudo](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/finance/virtual-credit-cards/mysudo) allows
        you to create and use virtual phone numbers for different people or groups. This is great for
        compartmentalisation.

    - point: Watch out for Stalkerware
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Stalkerware is malware that is installed directly onto your device by someone you know.
        The best way to get rid of it is through a factory reset.

    - point: Favor the Browser over Dedicated Apps
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        For many services (shopping, food-delivery, social media, banking), a hardened browser leaks less data than the official app. Browsers give you fine-grained control over cookies, scripts, containers and extensions, while native apps often run persistent background processes and include multiple trackers you cannot disable. Use a security-focused browser and pin key sites to your home screen as “web apps” if you want quick access without installing their app.

    - point: Consider running a custom ROM (Android)
      priority: Advanced
      details: >-
        If you're concerned about your device manufacturer collecting too much
        personal information, consider a privacy-focused custom ROM.

  description: Using IoT devices without compromising your privacy
  icon: home
  intro: >-
    Home assistants (such as Google Home, Alexa and Siri) and other internet connected
    devices collect large amounts of personal data (including voice samples, location data,
    home details and logs of all interactions). Since you have limited control on what is
    being collected, how it's stored, and what it will be used for, this makes it hard to
    recommend any consumer smart-home products to anyone who cares about privacy and security.

    Security vs Privacy: There are many smart devices on the market that claim to increase
    the security of your home while being easy and convenient to use (Such as Smart Burglar
    Alarms, Internet Security Cameras, Smart Locks and Remote access Doorbells to name a few).
    These devices may appear to make security easier, but there is a trade-off in terms of
    privacy: as they collect large amounts of personal data, and leave you without control
    over how this is stored or used. The security of these devices is also questionable,
    since many of them can be (and are being) hacked, allowing an intruder to bypass
    detection with minimum effort.

    The most privacy-respecting option, would be to not use "smart" internet-connected
    devices in your home, and not to rely on a security device that requires an internet
    connection. But if you do, it is important to fully understand the risks of any given
    product, before buying it. Then adjust settings to increase privacy and security.
    The following checklist will help mitigate the risks associated with
    internet-connected home devices.
  checklist:
    - point: Rename devices to not specify brand/model
      priority: Essential

    - point: Scrutinize Companion Smartphone Apps
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Most smart-home and wearable devices funnel data through their companion smartphone apps, which often include multiple trackers and broad
        permissions (location, contacts, background network access). Review these apps with tools like Exodus where possible, strip non-essential permissions,
        and avoid installing vendor apps you don't actually need to operate the device.

    - point: Don't link your smart home devices to your real identity
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Use anonymous usernames and passwords, avoiding sign-up/log-in via social media or other third-party services to maintain privacy.

  intro: >-
    Credit card fraud is the most common form of identity theft, with hundreds of thousands of reports annually
    according to [FTC data](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight).
    It's more important than ever to take basic steps to protect yourself from falling victim.

    Note about credit cards: Credit cards have technological methods in place to
    detect and stop some fraudulent transactions. Major payment processors implement
    this, by mining huge amounts of data from their card holders, in order to know
    a great deal about each persons spending habits. This data is used to identify
    fraud, but is also sold onto other data brokers. Credit cards are therefore good
    for security, but terrible for data privacy.
  checklist:
    - point: Sign up for Fraud Alerts and Credit Monitoring
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Enable fraud alerts and credit monitoring through Experian, TransUnion, or Equifax to be alerted of suspicious activity.

    - point: Harden Banking and Finance Apps
      priority: Essential
      details: >-
        Banking, brokerage, and payment apps often have stronger fraud controls than the web but also collect extensive telemetry. Install them only from
        official stores, keep them updated, disable non-essential permissions (contacts, Bluetooth, location where not needed), and avoid installing unrelated
        “financial assistant” apps that ask for full access to your email or bank logins.

    - point: Use Cryptocurrency for Online Transactions
      priority: Optional
      details: >-
        Opt for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like
        [Monero](https://awesome-privacy.xyz/finance/cryptocurrencies/monero) for
        online transactions to maintain anonymity. Use cryptocurrencies wisely to ensure privacy.

    Public records often include sensitive personal data (full name, date of birth,
    phone number, email, address, ethnicity etc), and are gathered from a range of
    sources (census records, birth/ death/ marriage certificates, voter registrants,
    marketing information, customer databases, motor vehicle records, professional/
    business licenses and all court files in full detail). This sensitive personal
    information is
    [easy and legal to access](https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/its-creepy-but-not-illegal-for-this-website-to-provide-all-your-public-info-to-anyone/),
    which raises some [serious privacy concerns](https://privacyrights.org/resources/public-records-internet-privacy-dilemma)

    CCTV is one of the major ways that the corporations, individuals and the government
    tracks your movements. In London, UK the average person is caught on camera about
    500 times per day. This network is continuing to grow, and in many cities around
    the world, facial recognition is being rolled out, meaning the state can know
    the identity of residents on the footage in real-time.

    Strong authentication, encrypted devices, patched software and anonymous web
    browsing may be of little use if someone is able to physically compromise you,
    your devices and your data. This section outlines some basic methods for physical security
