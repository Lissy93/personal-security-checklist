### Developing
To run the app locally, or to make code changes, you'll need Node and Git installed.

1. Grab the code: `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/personal-security-checklist.git`
2. Navigate into the source: `cd personal-security-checklist/web`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`
4. Start the development server: `yarn dev`

Alternatively, just open this repo in Code Spaces, where everything is already configured and ready to go.

### Deploying
To deploy the app, follow the developing steps above, then run `yarn build`, `yarn build.static`. You can then deploy it by copying the `dist/` directory to any CDN, web server or static hosting provider of your choice.
